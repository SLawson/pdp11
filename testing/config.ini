# This file is used by validate.py to coordinate validation. Each of the following sections is
# required:
#     [GENERAL]
#     [INVOCATIONS]
#     [FLAGS]
#     [FILES]
#
# Details on each section can be found below their headers. This file should be in the working
# directory of validate.py.

[PATHS]
# This section tells validate.py to find the program to test and where the model files will be.
# The executable path should be the full absolute path to the executable file that will be tested,
# including the file name itself. Out_path and model_path should be relative to this script's
# location.
#
# Example:
#  executable = /absolute/path/to/executable/program.exe
#  out_path = ./output
#  model_path = ./output 

executable = *****EXECUTABLE PATH HERE*****
out_path = output
model_path = model

[INVOCATIONS]
# Set the Test Case ID equal to the command line invocation required to execute that test case. Do not
# include the name of the program itself, just options that it needs to be called with. Test case IDs are
# not case sensitive.
#
# Example:
#  test1 = -f input_file -o output/output_file.txt
#  test2 = -f input_file2 -o subdirectory/output_file2.txt

A1 = -f input/arithmetic/addition.ascii -o output/arithmetic/addition.txt -r output/arithmetic/addition_r.txt
A2 = -f input/addressing/absolute.ascii -o output/addressing/absolute.txt -r output/addressing/absolute_r.txt

[FLAGS]
# List flags used in the invocations that designate output file names. These flags will be used to
# extract the file names and construct paths to the models for comparison.
flags = -r, -o

[FILES]
# List additional output files here that should be checked after a test case is run. It is assumed that 
# every file listed is in the folder designated with the "out_path" option in the PATHS section, and that
# there is a corresponding golden model file in the "model_path" directory to compare it to. If a test case
# requires multiple file comparisons, separate the files with a comma.
#
# Example:
#  test1 = output_file.txt
#  test2 = subdirectory/output_file2.txt, other_file.txt
